# AI_Network_IDS

The AI-Based Network Intrusion Detection System is designed to enhance network security by intelligently monitoring and analyzing network traffic using machine learning techniques. The system employs a Random Forest classifier to learn patterns from network traffic data and accurately distinguish between normal (benign) and malicious activities such as denial-of-service attacks and port scanning.Data collection or simulation, data preprocessing, model training, performance evaluation, and real-time traffic analysis are all included in the project's comprehensive workflow. Users can train the model, see performance metrics, and test real-time network traffic using an interactive simulator on an intuitive, web-based dashboard created with Streamlit.This system shows how artificial intelligence can be used in cybersecurity to decrease false positives, increase intrusion detection accuracy, and offer real-time insights. The project is appropriate for scholarly use and provides a basis for additional investigation and advancement in AI-powered network security solutions.
The AI-Based Network Intrusion Detection System is intended for the following end users:
Network Administrators: To monitor network traffic, detect intrusions in real time, and take preventive security measures.
Cybersecurity Analysts: To analyze malicious traffic patterns, evaluate attack behavior, and improve security strategies.
Organizations and Enterprises: To enhance the security of corporate networks, servers, and cloud infrastructures.
Academic Institutions: For students and researchers to study, experiment with, and demonstrate AI-based cybersecurity solutions.
Government and Critical Infrastructure Agencies: To protect sensitive networks from cyber threats and unauthorized access.
